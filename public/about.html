<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am simple And creative who has an habit to try new things always. I always try to stay positive whatever happens in my life 
  and that is how i think i want to be always.
</p>

<p>Ups and Downs are common in life so i dont want to boast that i am a king when i am in my raising 
  graph and demotivate myself when i am in a downfall.I want to take everything equally
</p>

<p>Life itself is beautiful, Its something we should cherish but not something we should frown upon.
  Should be Happy and content in what we have and should strive harder to achieve what we are not able to have .</p>

  <h3>"Life is how you see it, if you think it is hard,It is hard but if you think its beautiful It is amazing"</h3>
